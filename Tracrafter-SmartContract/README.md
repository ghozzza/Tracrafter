# ðŸ›  Deploy & Validate Smart Contracts with Foundry (TraCrafter)

This guide details the process to deploy, test, and verify the smart contracts for the TraCrafter project using [Foundry](https://github.com/foundry-rs/foundry).

---
## ðŸ“Œ Prerequisites
Before you begin, ensure your system has the following installed:
- **Foundry** â†’ Install it with:
  ```sh
  curl -L https://foundry.paradigm.xyz | bash
  foundryup
  ```
- **Git** â†’ for cloning the repository.

- **Ethereum Node Provider** (e.g., Alchemy, Infura, or Anvil for local testing)

---

## ðŸ“‹ Clone the Repository
Clone the TraCrafter smart contracts repository from GitHub:
```sh
git clone https://github.com/ghozzza/Tracrafter.git
cd smart-contracts
```

---

## ðŸ”§ Install Dependencies
Set up all necessary dependencies by running:
```sh
forge install
```

---

## ðŸš€ Compile Smart Contracts
Compile your Solidity contracts located in the src/ folder with:
```sh
forge build
```
This will compile the contracts located in the `src/` folder.

---

## ðŸ§ª Run Unit Tests
Ensure everything works as expected by executing the unit tests:
```sh
forge test
```
For detailed debugging information, run:
```sh
forge test -vvvv
```

---

## ðŸ”¥ Deploy Smart Contracts
Deploy your contracts to a test network (for example, Sepolia) with:
```sh
forge script scripts/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url $RPC_URL --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```
For local deployment using Anvil:
```sh
anvil &
forge script scripts/Deploy.s.sol --rpc-url http://127.0.0.1:8545 --private-key $PRIVATE_KEY --broadcast
```

---

## âœ… Verify Smart Contracts
After deployment, verify your contracts on Etherscan:
```sh
forge verify-contract --chain-id 11155111 --num-of-optimizations 200 --watch <DEPLOYED_CONTRACT_ADDRESS> <CONTRACT_PATH>:<CONTRACT_NAME> --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```
Example for `IssuesClaim.sol`:
```sh
forge verify-contract --chain-id 11155111 --num-of-optimizations 200 --watch 0xab104a8271eb37f2c244130afbc574a80dcd5c09 src/IssuesClaim.sol:IssuesClaim --etherscan-api-key $ETHERSCAN_API_KEY
```

## ðŸŽ¯ Wrap-Up
Excellent work! You have successfully deployed, tested, and verified the TraCrafter smart contracts using Foundry. If you run into any issues, double-check your environment variables or refer to the official Foundry [documentation](https://book.getfoundry.sh/) for further guidance.ðŸš€
